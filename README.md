# OSU Challenge Website

This repository contains both the frontend static files and the backend API.

## Running the backend

The backend code lives in [`osu-backend`](./osu-backend). To start the server run `node app.js` from inside that directory:

```bash
cd osu-backend
node app.js
```

You can also run `node server.js`, which simply requires `app.js`.
